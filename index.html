        <h2>❤️ Nammo ❤️</h2>
        <p>Dear Nameera Sultana ❤️,
            Or should i call you my world 🌍. I call you different names at different time.
            But for me You're still the nohaqu33n 👑 i met that haven't changed even a bit. You're still the noha that i
            liked ❤️.
            You're still the nammo that i love ❤️. You're still the princess 👸 i wanted. You're still the most beautiful
            girl i ever saw. You're still the best friend that i made and You're still the one that i loved, that i love
            and that i will love my whole life ❤️. And i wish to be the one for you that i want to be in my life 💍. I know
            you know what i want to be.
            <br>
            I had a life before you and i know it was full of mistakes, wrong people, wrong things and a lot of wrong
            decisions that i made in my life. But when i met you, when i talked to you i felt something that i never
            felt before. Even after being a guy full of mistakes I still wanted you and choosing you was the best
            decision of my life. it really was. You changed my life ,Made me a better person ,helped me correct my
            mistakes. If i am a good person now . It's because of you ❤️. It was you who invested in me when i was piece of
            glass and then made me shine like a diamond 💎. A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor it would have
            been me without you.
            <br>
            Now i am with you happy 😊, perfect, complete. I love you ❤️... you complete me. All that you are is all that i
            will ever need in my life. You are the one person that i want and no way i am going to settle for anyone
            else. I am okay with all your moods , All your decisions and all your needs. I am fine with everything as
            long as it makes you happy ❤️. I am living a perfect life, I love that you're the first person that i think of
            when i am up 🌄 and the last person i talk to before i go to sleep 😴 and even in my dreams it's you making me
            crazy with you gorgeous smile 😊. No matter where I go, or what I do, I’m thinking of you 🤔 because....I love
            you ❤️.
            <br>
            When we love someone, we find ways to tell them how much we love them. Just like me, It's my work to find
            words to tell you how beautiful your are inside and you. But i guess the world is running
            short with the words that can define how amazing my princess 👸 nammo is. and i get it why they don't have
            enough words, i guess it's maybe because they never thought that there could be a person as beautiful as you
            are.
            <br>
            I think of you in every mood of mine. I remember the words that you once told me "Mai sabse zyada aap ku
            chahtiu mumma daddy k baad, meku kabhi hurt mat ko" and that's what my intention is meri jaan ❤️, To never hurt
            you , To love you the most , To keep you always first, To keep you always happy 😊, To keep you the most
            important person in my life.
            I love you ❤️ more than my words can describe, you mean the world to me.
            <br>
            I pray 🤲 that god bless you good health, endless happiness 😊, great success and grant you with everything that
            you wish for and everything that's good for you that you never imagined.
            <br>
